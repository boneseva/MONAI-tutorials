# MONAI Tutorials
This repository hosts the MONAI tutorials.

### 1. Requirements
Most of the examples and tutorials require
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

These could be installed by:
```bash
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -U matplotlib
python -m pip install -U notebook
```

Some of the examples may require optional dependencies. In case of any optional import errors,
please install the relevant packages according to the error message.
Or install all optional requirements by:
```
pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/master/requirements-dev.txt
```

#### [multi_gpu_test](./multi_gpu_test.ipynb)
This notebook is a quick demo for devices, run the Ignite trainer engine on CPU, GPU and multiple GPUs.
#### [nifti_read_example](./nifti_read_example.ipynb)
Illustrate reading NIfTI files and iterating over image patches of the volumes loaded from them.
#### [dynunet_tutorial](./dynunet_tutorial.ipynb)
This tutorial shows how to train 3D segmentation tasks on all the 10 decathlon datasets with the reimplementation of dynUNet in MONAI.
#### [post_transforms](./post_transforms.ipynb)
This notebook shows the usage of several post transforms based on the model output of spleen segmentation task.
#### [public_datasets](./public_datasets.ipynb)
This notebook shows how to quickly set up training workflow based on `MedNISTDataset` and `DecathlonDataset`, and how to create a new dataset.
#### [spleen_segmentation_3d](./spleen_segmentation_3d.ipynb)
This notebook is an end-to-end training and evaluation example of 3D segmentation based on [MSD Spleen dataset](http://medicaldecathlon.com).
The example shows the flexibility of MONAI modules in a PyTorch-based program:
- Transforms for dictionary-based training data structure.
- Load NIfTI images with metadata.
- Scale medical image intensity with expected range.
- Crop out a batch of balanced image patch samples based on positive / negative label ratio.
- Cache IO and transforms to accelerate training and validation.
- 3D UNet, Dice loss function, Mean Dice metric for 3D segmentation task.
- Sliding window inference.
- Deterministic training for reproducibility.
#### [spleen_segmentation_3d_lightning](./spleen_segmentation_3d_lightning.ipynb)
